=== CSS files



==== Javascript files




==== Making page more responsive
1. All the js files are combined into all.js while serving using :cache => true in the javascript_include_tag
2. All the css files are combined into all.css while serving using :cache => true in the stylesheets_include_tag
3. Rake task cache_assets.rake (in /lib/tasks) used to create the “all.js” and “all.css” automatically using Rails, because I’m using the “:cache => true” option in my helpers. It’ll commit those files (if they’ve been changed) and then when I set “config.action_controller.perform_caching = true” in my “config/environments/production.rb” file, Heroku app will use the cached files automatically. From http://trevorturk.com/2011/01/18/caching-assets-in-a-rails-3-app-on-heroku/
4. Added cron take that runs hourly on heroku. Just makes GET request to homepage. /lib/tasks/cron.rake.



===== Models


  --------------Post Model------------------
1. The Post model has following members

 avatar - is the attached file on Amazon S3 bucket "catsinyourhats".




2. Methods:

updatepost(post) -- Combines all the images (img_all ImageList) into a final image using rmagick "flatten_images"
Image files for the arrays are set in these methods


setCoordinates(post,params) --

params[:pid] is catn or hatn. This helps to choose whose coordinates to set 
params[:rid] is catn or hatn. This helps to choose whose size to set 

If backimg is set using rCarousel, update backimg attribute for the model








---------------User Model-----------------------

1. Uses omniauth to get token from facebook (content provider facebook)
Logic to Create or Retrieve new user is given in SessionController#create

2. Passes the token of current_user to Fb_graph gem to post to FB

3. current_user - Either retrieve user or make a new user. Logic given in application_controller 
 @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]   in application controller



---------------Catwalk Model-----------------------
Paperclip file :catpic which is stored in Amazon S3 bucket 'catsinyourhats'
Cannot create new model without presence of :catpic whose types can be jpeg, png, or gif


-------------Members only areas------------------

1. Non members can only access PostsController#frontpage. This is done by using :before_filter in the PostsController

2. Non members can also access PostsController#Index. Need to remove access atleast for non-members.

--------------When User logs in ------------------
1. Users can log in by clicking sign in button or CIYh game button or Catwalks button. This throws a fancybox popup.
The div ids of the fancybox are various1, various2, various3, various4

2. The display in the fancybox for login has the following divs : signin (CIYH game link in header), signin2 (Catwalks link in header), signin3 (CIYH game link in header), signin4 (Catwalks link in header)

3. Rack middleware used to redirect user to proper page after logging in (using omniauth) is given in /lib/store_redirect_to.rb
The Rack middleware intercepts when the path is /auth/facebook?redirect_to=/catwalks and saves the path in ruby variable signin. The redirect_to param is saved in ruby variable redirect.




-------------------Header/Layout ---------------------

main.html.erb layout is used for all actions. For the CIYH game, cats and hats images are included at top of _form.html.erb before including the all.js (javascript files combined).


-----------------CIYH game ---------------------------
When cat or hat is dragged send the id of the image and the size of the resized image
If a cat or hat is moved, set the moved id to 1 and include the image in the image array 
When cat or hat image is resized, send the id of the image and the size of the resized image
When page is resized, send the x and y offset co-ordinates of the background image
rCarousel is used to display the background images
When an image in rCarousel is clicked, send the filename using Ajax and store in backimg attribute.
Combine the image array into one image 

Paperclip is used to store the image on Amazon S3



------------------Catwalks----------------------------
Paperclip is used to store the image on Amazon S3
Allows only jpeg, png, gif
Added "thumb" size : 170px x 128 px for display in catwalks index page


------------------Custom error pages -----------------
Custom error pages implemented in Rails using ActionDispatch (as escape from exception cannot be handled in actionController,but is handled in Rake middleware instead of rails 3)
refer to http://accuser.cc/posts/1-rails-3-0-exception-handling

This was done by adding an initializer "showexceptions.rb" and a new controller "ErrorsController"

-Added "not found", "unprocessable_entry" and "internal_server_error" pages
- Need to change the message slightly to be more user responsive


--------------------------Ajax errors --------------------
Need to find:
When do Ajax errors happen? Is it because of server update? 
Is it a browser issues (firefox vs safari)?
Does it happen when FB token refreshes? or the user does not use app for long time?
Does it happen does server side protection against ajax? (wrongly applied settings)
