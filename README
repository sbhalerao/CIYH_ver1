=== CSS files



==== Javascript files




==== Making page more responsive
1. All the js files are combined into all.js while serving using :cache => true in the javascript_include_tag
2. All the css files are combined into all.css while serving using :cache => true in the stylesheets_include_tag
3. Rake task cache_assets.rake (in /lib/tasks) used to create the “all.js” and “all.css” automatically using Rails, because I’m using the “:cache => true” option in my helpers. It’ll commit those files (if they’ve been changed) and then when I set “config.action_controller.perform_caching = true” in my “config/environments/production.rb” file, Heroku app will use the cached files automatically. From http://trevorturk.com/2011/01/18/caching-assets-in-a-rails-3-app-on-heroku/
4. Added cron take that runs hourly on heroku. Just makes GET request to homepage. /lib/tasks/cron.rake.



===== Models


  --------------Post Model------------------
1. The Post model has following members









---------------User Model-----------------------

1. Uses omniauth to get token from facebook (content provider facebook)
Logic to Create or Retrieve new user is given in SessionController#create

2. Passes the token of current_user to Fb_graph gem to post to FB
3. current_user - Either retrieve user or make a new user. Logic given in application_controller 
 @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]   in application controller



-------------Members only areas------------------

1. Non members can only access PostsController#frontpage. This is done by using :before_filter in the PostsController

2. Non members can also access PostsController#Index. Need to remove access atleast for non-members.

--------------When User logs in ------------------
1. Users can log in by clicking sign in button or CIYh game button or Catwalks button. This throws a fancybox popup.
The div ids of the fancybox are various1, various2, various3, various4

2. The display in the fancybox for login has the following divs : signin (CIYH game link in header), signin2 (Catwalks link in header), signin3 (CIYH game link in header), signin4 (Catwalks link in header)

3. Rack middleware used to redirect user to proper page after logging in (using omniauth) is given in /lib/store_redirect_to.rb
The Rack middleware intercepts when the path is /auth/facebook?redirect_to=/catwalks and saves the path in ruby variable signin. The redirect_to param is saved in ruby variable redirect.




-------------------Header/Layout ---------------------

main.html.erb layout is used for all actions except CIYH game which is PostsController#new 


-----------------CIYH game ---------------------------

If a cat or hat is moved, set the moved id to 1 and include the image in the image array
